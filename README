Welcome to Genhydro, the Hydrogen Drumkit Generator!

Genhydro is a simple Python script that will convert a directory full
of sound files into a Hydrogen drumkit (.h2drumkit).

It is a script of convenience and is not [yet] very robust. You can
definitely make better drumkits with more features (like velocity
detection) by hand, but that takes a lot more work. So if you're
someone with lots of sound files that you just want to get up and
running in H2, then this script might be of use.

How to use it now:
------------------

1. Change to the directory containing all your .flac files.

2. Run genhydro.py

3. That's it. You are left with an h2drumkit file, which you can re-distribute or import into Hydrogen for personal use.


Limitations:
------------

Right now, there are many. Eventually, I hope to make this much more robust.

- must be in the directory you want to convert
- cannot define velocity changes within the drumkit
- must use flac files (you can use sox or ffmpeg to convert files to flac)
- the code is a little ugly


Enjoy.
